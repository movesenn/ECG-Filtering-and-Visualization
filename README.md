This is a program that I wrote and used in order to process and visualize ECG data. I used a high-pass butterworth filter at 1hz and two notch filters: one at 50hz and one at 150hz (harmonic frequency of 50hz).
1. Download rec_1.dat, rec_1.atr, rec_1.hea files.
2. Import the 3 files above into whatever IDE you prefer.
3. Run the code.
